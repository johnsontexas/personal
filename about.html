				I am currently a student at Strake Jesuit College Prep. I have grown up in Houston, Texas, and from a young age, I have always been interested in athletics. I have competed in many sports such as basketball, baseball, track, cross country, swim team, lacrosse, football, soccer, tennis, and golf.
				I also have a passion for technology, where I have made several websites from scratch (like this one). I have also worked on and developed games. I have worked with many coding and development programs such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and Unreal Engine.
				I love leadership, and throughout my life, I have participated in leadership  from being president of student council in my younger years to currently co-leading clubs like the AI Development Club at my high school.
				I have always been an active Catholic, and in more recent years, I have thought a lot about the theology and philosophy behind my faith.
				I work hard to be the best person I can possibly be, which is why I participate in service both in and outside of my school.
				I have recently dreamed about growing up and going into a career that saves lives. I want to make a difference in this world, and I will work towards that goal.
				I am extremely interested in linguistics, since I was born and raised speaking English and Spanish.
				Starting freshman year, I took Mandarin even though I had never spoken it before, and I started to fall deeper in love with linguistics. I am planning on taking it all four years of my high school career. 
				Along with that, I am currently learning German on the side, and I have basic communication skills in it. I have also recently started learning Russian, which is a work in progress at the moment.
