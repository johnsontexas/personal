			<p align="center">I am currently a student at Strake Jesuit College Prep, I have grown up in Houston are Texas and starting from a young age I have always been interested in atheletics, I have competed in many sports such as basketball, baseball, track, cross country, swim team, lacrosse, football, soccer, tennis, and golf. 
				I also have a passion for techology where I have made several websites from scratch (like this one). I have also worked on and developed games. I have worked with many coding/devleopment programs such as html, css, js, java, roblox studio and unreal engine.
				I love leadership and througout my life I have participated in leadership guided programs through being president of student council in my younger years to currently co-leading clubs like the ai development club at my high school.
				I have always been an active Catholic and in more recent years I have thought alot about Theology and philosphy behind my faith.
				I work hard to be the best person I can possibly be which is why I participate in service in and outside of my school,
				I have recently dreamed about growing up and going into a career that saves lives. I want to make a diffirence in this world and I will work towards that goal.
				I am extreamly intreested in lingusitics  since I was born and raised speaking english and spansih.
				Starting freshmen I took Mandarin even though I had never spoken it before and I started to fall deeper in love
				with lingusitics and I am planning on taking it all 4 years of my highschool career. Along with that I am currently
				learning German on the side where I have basic communication skills in German. Along with German I have recently started learning Russian
				which is a work in progress at the moment.
