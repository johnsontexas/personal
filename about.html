					<h3>Background</h3>

						tennis, and golf.

					<p>
						Leadership has been a significant part of my life. I have served as president of student council 
						in my younger years and currently co-lead clubs like the AI Development Club at my high school.

				<section class="linguistics-section" style="background-image: none;">
					<h3>Language & Linguistics</h3>
					<p>
						My interest in linguistics stems from being raised bilingual in English and Spanish. Starting freshman year, 
						I took Mandarin Chinese and fell in love with linguistics. I plan to continue studying Mandarin throughout 
						high school. Additionally, I'm learning German and have basic communication skills, while also beginning 
						to learn Russian.
					</p>

					<h3>Future Aspirations</h3>

						I dream of pursuing a career that makes a meaningful impact on people's lives. My goal is to make a 
						difference in this world, and I am committed to working towards that objective through my education 
						and personal development.
